"""
main.py

The main entry point of the Security Log Analysis & Intrusion Detection system. 
This file reads raw log lines from a file (currently sample.log), uses 'parse.py' to 
convert them into structured data, and periodically runs both threshold-based anomaly 
detection (from 'anomaly.py')and event correlation checks. 
Any suspicious findings get written to an output file.
